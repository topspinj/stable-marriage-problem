    "# Stable Matching Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The Stable Matching Problem (SMP) is a classic mathematics problem that involves combinatorial theory of orderded sets. Though SMP was initially described in the context of marriage, it has applications in other fields such as matching medical students to residency programs (e.g., [NRMP](http://www.nrmp.org/matching-algorithm/) and [CaRMS](https://www.carms.ca/the-match/how-it-works/)) and college admissions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example of marriage, the problem involves a set of women and a set of men of equal size. Both women and men list in order of preference the members of the other sex. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/matching.png\" width=\"60%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is to assign men to women (or vice versa) in a way that takes into account their preferences. A matching is deemed unstable if:\n",
    "- woman A and man A are paired but woman A prefers man B **and**\n",
    "- man B is paired with woman B but prefers woman A \n",
    "\n",
    "This would be considered an unstable marriage since woman A and man B simultaneously prefer each other than their respective matches. The goal is to determine the optimal assignments such that all matchings are stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/unstable-match.png\" width=\"30%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1962, David Gale and Lloyd Shapely developed an [algorithm](http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/251958.pdf) to solve this problem. The algorithm works under the following assumptions:\n",
    "1. Women can only propose to men, not vice versa.\n",
    "2. If woman $w$ proposes to man $m$ and $m$ is free, then $w$ and $m$ become engaged.\n",
    "3. If a man gets multiple proposals, he rejects all but his top choice.\n",
    "4. Each rejected woman proposes to her next best choice regardless of whether that man is currently engaged.\n",
    "5. If an engaged man receives a proposal from a woman that he prefers over his current woman, he breaks his proposal and becomes engaged to his preferred choice.\n",
    "6. These steps are repeated until all proposals (matchings) are stable."

    "As shown above, the matchings are different based on whether the men vs. women were \"suitors\" vs. \"reviewers\". In both situations, sutiors are assigned their best possible match. A suitor's final matching might not be their top choice, but this is because their top choice has rejected him or her along the way for a better suitor. Furthermore, reviewers (i.e., the ones receiving the proposal) are assigned their  worst possible match, while still maintaining stable matchings. While it may seem like the person receiving the proposal has more choice in their ultimate partner, the Gale-Shapely algorithm demonstrates that the suitor who makes the proposals will have their optimal match. \n",
